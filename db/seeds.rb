It can also be used a s a shampoo bar. Organic Coconut Oil is moisturising and easily absorbed. Coconut oil also contains properties that feed and hydrate your skin with additional antibacterial and antifungal benefits. Coconut oil is a powerful moisturizer that is beneficial to restoring dry or flaking skin as well. Using the Natural Coconut Oil Soap Bar as a shampoo: Commercial shampoos are usually made with surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate ‚Äì which is a known skin irritant that is often contaminated with the probable human carcinogen 1,4 dioxane ‚Äì instead of soap. They also often contain silicone that coats the hair and prevents it from absorbing moisture. While silicone can make hair look smooth and shiny in the short-term, over time it causes it to dry out and become more brittle over time. When you make the switch to natural shampoo, you‚Äôre going from an approach that strips hair and then coats it with polymers to something that washes and nourishes the hair with a natural oil. During the transition you may find that your hair feels a little ‚Äúgummy‚Äù ‚Äì this can happen as silicone and other polymers begin to peel off. Another reason hair can seem dry or dull is that it soap is alkaline, and your hair prefers a more acidic environment. When washing with soap, you need to keep it happy by restoring hair pH with an acidic rinse* after shampooing. If used regularly, progressive results help encourage clean, manageable healthy hair and scalp, with the appearance of more body and thickness. Say goodbye to hair that appears dull, lifeless and dry. *Apple Cider Rinse The rinse acts as a ‚Äúconditioner‚Äù that balances pH, smooths the cuticle and makes your hair super shiny. In most cases you won‚Äôt need an additional conditioner, because shampoo bars moisturize while cleansing. How to make and use Apple Cider Rinse: ¬º ‚Äì ¬Ω cup apple cider vinegar and enough filtered water to bring vinegar mixture to 3/4 cup. Mix ingredients. Pour over hair to saturate and allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then rinse. Cool water will help the hair cuticle close, but warm is good too üôÇ **Please store your soap in a dry place and keep away from water.
